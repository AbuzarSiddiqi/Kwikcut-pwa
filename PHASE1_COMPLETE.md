## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Before Testing

### You MUST Complete These Steps:

#### 1. Create Firebase Project

Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and:

- Create a new project named "KwikCut"
- Enable **Email/Password** authentication
- Create Firestore Database (production mode)
- Enable Storage

#### 2. Add Firebase Config

Create `.env.local` in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

#### 3. Set Firebase Security Rules

Copy the rules from `QUICKSTART.md` to:

- Firestore Database → Rules
- Storage → Rules

#### 4. Restart the Server

After adding `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```
